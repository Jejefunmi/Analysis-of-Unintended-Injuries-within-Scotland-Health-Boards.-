# Analysis-of-Unintended-Injuries-within-Scotland-Health-Boards.

## Project Summary
## Introduction:
I undertook an analysis project to examine Unintended Injuries within Scotland Health Boards. The goal was to comprehensively assess and understand the landscape of unintentional injuries within Scotland Health Board.
## Project Scope and Objectives
The scope of the project encompassed Health board 2014 - Health board 2019.csv and Council area 2011 â€“ Council area 2019.csv, with the primary objectives being;
 1) Determining admissions for unintentional injuries in Scotland for the finacial year 2022/23 and the pecentage of these admissions is for falls.
 2) Health board with the largest unintentional injuries
 3) Health board with the largest number of admissions for road traffic accidents in 2019/20 and the percentage of these admissions were for males
 4) Percentage change in admissions for Scalds in the home in NHS Lothian Health Board from 2019/20 t0 2020/21
 5) Age group with high unintentional injury in 2022/23
 6) Visualising male on admission for 2022/2023
## Methodology
I utilized open-source repositories, to source for dataset, The Office for National Statistics (ONS) was a primary data source for data collection and employed Excel with it integrated tool, Power Quary for Exploratory Analysis. Excel Pivot table was employed to summarize and analyse the dataset, providing relationship, pattern, and Data visualization.
## Data Analysis
The analysis involved;
 * Data cleaning;  I addressed inconsistencies, missing values,handling outliner and any data anomalies to ensure the datasets were prepared for further analysis.
 * Dataset Integration with Power Query;
 Multiple datasets were integrated using Power Query to create a consolidated dataset.
 Joins and merges were performed to combine relevant information from different sources, facilitating a comprehensive and cohesive dataset for analysis.
 * Pivot Table Analysis:
 I used pivote table for Aggregations, grouping, and filtering the integrated dataset. i extracted the solutions to the aboved mentioned objectives from pivote table.
Notable Challenges Encountered:
1) Data Quality Issues:
The dataset presented significant challenges related to data quality. A notable concern was the presence of null values, indicating incomplete information. These gaps in the data posed obstacles to a comprehensive analysis and required meticulous handling during the cleaning process.

2) Council Code C92000003 as a Country Code for Scotland:
A distinctive challenge emerged with the council code C92000003, designated as a country code for Scotland. This code appeared to contain values that were an aggregate of all council values, introducing a level of redundancy and compromising the uniqueness of the data.
5. Key Findings:
The analysis revealed that;
* Greater Glasgow tops the charts for male hospital admissions due to unintentional injuries at home, followed closely by NHS Lothian. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian and NHS Tayside exhibit similar numbers.
* The leading cause of unintentional injuries, unsurprisingly, is falls. 
* Individuals aged 75 and above experience a significantly higher burden of unintentional injuries, with females bearing the brunt. 

## Recommendations:
1) Recommendations for Fall Prevention in Older Adults:

* Implementation of Specific Exercises:
Introduce targeted exercise programs designed to enhance strength, balance, and flexibility in older adults. Incorporating exercises tailored to individual needs can significantly contribute to fall prevention.

* Home Modifications and Environmental Adjustments:
Advocate for home modifications and environmental adjustments to create safer living spaces. This may include installing grab bars, improving lighting, and removing tripping hazards. These measures aim to minimize fall risks within the home environment.

* Utilization of Technology Solutions:
Explore and implement technology solutions that can aid in fall prevention. This may involve the use of wearable devices, smart home technologies, or alert systems to provide timely assistance or notification in the event of a potential fall.

2) Recommendations for Targeted Interventions for Elderly Females:

* Information Sharing on Community Programs:
Facilitate access to community programs specifically tailored to the needs of elderly females. Promote awareness and participation in local initiatives that address health and wellness, fostering a sense of community and support.

* Distribution of Health Education Materials:
Develop and disseminate health education materials that focus on the unique health challenges faced by elderly females. Providing informative materials can empower them with knowledge about preventive measures, healthy lifestyle choices, and available healthcare resources.

* Introduction of Technology Tools Designed for Their Needs:
Introduce user-friendly technology tools that cater to the specific needs of elderly females. This may include apps or devices that facilitate health monitoring, medication management, or communication with healthcare providers, promoting active engagement in their own well-being.
